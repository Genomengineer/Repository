# Repository
Here, I collect my C++ projects and useful stuff, regarding this programming language.

Also, I am looking for an entry-level C++ programmer job for professional like me. It can be the development of software for biotech/ pharma industries as I have Ph. D. in biosciences and about 20 years of hands-on experience in different fields like microbiology, genome engineering, molecular biology, virology; you name it.

Many thanks!
