Hi! My name is Vitaliy Kolisnychenko.
Here, I collect my C++ projects and some useful stuff.

I am looking for an entry-level C++ programmer position. It can be in the area of software development for biotech/ pharma industries as I have Ph. D. in biosciences and about 20 years of hands-on experience in different fields like microbiology, genome engineering, molecular biology, virology, biochemistry, gene therapy, and epigenetics.

Many thanks!
